    <h1>What is an engine  ?</h1>
    <p>An engine is a machine that can convert some form of energy (obtained from a fuel) into useful mechanical power or motion. If the engine produces kinetic energy (energy of motion) from a fuel source, it is called a prime mover; if it produces kinetic energy from a preprocessed "fuel" (such as electricity, a flow of hydraulic fluid, or compressed air), it is called a motor.</p>
    <p>The story of the 2JZ-GTE begins in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a time when Toyota was looking to enhance its presence in the high-performance vehicle market. 

At that point, Toyotaâ€™s flagship performance straight six was the three-litre 7M-GTE, which powered the third-gen Supra (A70) and second-gen Soarer (Z20). While it was a decent engine for its time, it did suffer from several well-known weaknesses and lacked the robustness Toyota was after.

The goal was to develop an engine that could rival the best in the industry, particularly the game-changing RB26DETT powering the recently-released Nissan R32 Skyline GT-R. Toyota aimed to create a powerplant that was not only powerful but also exceptionally reliable and capable of handling far greater power levels in motorsport applications without compromising durability.

The JZ family of engines debuted in 1990 with the introduction of the 1JZ-GTE, a 2.5-litre inline-six twin-turbo engine. The success of the 1JZ-GTE laid the groundwork for its larger and more powerful sibling. </p>

    <h1>What is an engine  ?</h1>
    <p>An engine is a machine that can convert some form of energy (obtained from a fuel) into useful mechanical power or motion. If the engine produces kinetic energy (energy of motion) from a fuel source, it is called a prime mover; if it produces kinetic energy from a preprocessed "fuel" (such as electricity, a flow of hydraulic fluid, or compressed air), it is called a motor.</p>
